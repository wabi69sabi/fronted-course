       <h2>Mariposa Grove</h2>
       <p>Mariposa Grove is a sequoia grove located near Wawona, California,
       United States, in the southernmost part of Yosemite National Park.</p>

       <p>It is the largest grove of Giant Sequoias in the park, with several
       hundred mature examples of the tree. Two of its trees are among the 30
       largest Giant Sequoias in the world.</p>

       <p>The Mariposa Grove was first visited by non-natives in 1857 when Galen
       Clark and Milton Mann found it. They named the grove after Mariposa County,
       California, where the grove is located.</p>

       <p>Abraham Lincoln signed an Act of Congress on June 30, 1864 ceding
       Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley to the state of California. Criticism of
       stewardship over the land led to the state's returning the grove to federal
       control with the establishment of Yosemite National Park.</p>

       <p>The Mariposa Grove Museum, the small building shown in the first photo,
       is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
